All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

# Unreleased

## Fixed

- Since the media type parameters are not standardised (apart from the quality one), the negotiator will discard them during the matching process or simply treat them as strings/numbers without trying to guess anything more [#1159](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1159)

## Changed

- **BREAKING**: The `getHttpOperationsFromSpec` and `getHttpOperationsFromResource` have been moved from the HTTP Package to the CLI package. If you're using Prism programmatically, this might require some code changes on your side [#1009](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1009)
- **BREAKING**: The `createClientFromOperations` is now exported as `export function` instead of exporting an object. If you're using Prism programmatically, this might require some code changes on your side [#1009](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1009)

# 3.3.4 (2020-05-04)

## Fixed

- The mock diagram has been updated to include the security validations [#1141](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1141)
- Prism will now correctly refuse invalid requests even when used with the `proxy` command with the `--errors` flag [#1101](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1101)
- Autogenerated security validation errors now have the `detail` field filled with an informative message [#1101](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1101)
- Correctly catch some exceptions and propagate them to the CLI [#1107](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1107)

# 3.3.3 (2020-04-02)

## Fixed

- All the dependencies used by the various Prism packages have been explicitily declared avoiding some resolutions problems in case you are using Prism programmatically [#1072](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1072)
- Prism's current options aren't overriden internally anymore because of the `Prefer` header set [#1074](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1074)

## Fixed

- Prism is now able to correctly differentiate between a preflight request and a regular `OPTIONS` request [#1031](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1031)
- Fixed a condition where Prism would ignore CLI flags in case the nor `Prefer` or Query String preferences were passed [#1034](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/1034)

- By upgrading Json Schema Faker to the latest version, now the schemas with `additionalProperties:false` / `additionalProperties:true` / `additionalProperties:object` will be correctly handled when dynamic mocking is enabled [#719](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/719)
- Making a request to an operation with a `deprecated` parameter is no longer causing Prism to return a 422 response [#721](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism/pull/721)

- Prism now correctly validates OAS2 `application/x-www-urlencoded` (form data) params (#483)

# 3.0.3 (2019-07-25)

## Fixed
