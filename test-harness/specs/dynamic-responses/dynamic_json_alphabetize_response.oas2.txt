====test====
Prism generates dynamic values when instructed to do so.

Given there are no examples defined for an operation
And this operation can produce application/json response
And this operation response defines a Schema Object
And I make a request to this operation
And the request has Accept header of application/json
Then I should get a response with dynamically generated JSON as payload that is aplphabetized.
