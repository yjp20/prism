====test====
Prism generates dynamic values for schema when the __dynamic query parameter is set.
Given an operation that can produce application/json response
And this operation has a response with schema
And I make a request to this operation
And the request has Accept header of application/json
And I add __dynamic=true to the query path
Then I should get a response with dynamically generated JSON as payload
