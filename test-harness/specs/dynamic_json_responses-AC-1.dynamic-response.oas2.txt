====test====
Prism generates dynamic values for schema when no static examples are provided.

Given there are no examples defined for an operation
And this operation can produce application/json response
And this operation response defines a Schema Object
And I make a request to this operation
And the request has Accept header of application/json
Then I should get a response with dynamically generated JSON as payload
====spec====
